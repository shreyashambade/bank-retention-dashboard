# Customer Engagement & Product Utilization Analytics for Retention Strategy

## Project Overview
Banks increasingly recognize that customer engagement and product utilization play a critical role in long-term retention. Customers may appear financially strong based on balance or salary but may still churn due to weak engagement with banking services.

This project analyzes customer engagement patterns, product adoption behavior, and financial commitment indicators to understand how they influence customer churn.

The project includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), retention KPIs, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time analytics.
